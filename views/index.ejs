<h1>My Enneagram Personality Test Result</h1>

<p>I am a mediator of the group and thrive when helping differing parties resolve conflict.</p>
<p>My motivation stems from a desire for peace of mind and fears of experiencing overwhelming strife.</p>
<p>I can handle difficult conversations and remain level-headed. I am commonly the person people go to when they need a resolution or a second opinion concerning a pressing issue ü§ù.</p>
